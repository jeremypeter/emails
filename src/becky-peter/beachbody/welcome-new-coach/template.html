Also, you should have received another email from Beachbody that includes the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33604129/beckypeter.com/email/pdfs/BusinessQuickStartGuide.pdf">Business Quick Start</a> guide, which is a very useful tool that will help you immensely. I highly suggest you starting with that first. It also provides you with a short list to add the names of people you would like to talk to first about your new journey as a coach. After all, as a coach, we try to live and lead positive and healthy lives and enjoy sharing our passion and journey with others. </td>

             <td class="p">I highly recommend making a “to-do” list from this email, that way you feel less overwhelmed and are able to go through your list every day during your “designated” coach/business hours. In the beginning, I highly recommend setting aside at least 60 minutes daily to work on your business. It does NOT have to be all at once. It’s okay to break it down into chunks throughout the day. However, if you have more time to spend, then that will benefit you greatly because it will only help you advance in your business faster. But don’t stress too much if you don’t have more time, because let me tell you…you can do A LOT in 60 minutes if you stay focused. I will gladly go with you at the pace you feel most comfortable with.</td>

             <td class="p">Secondly, please realize that building your business with take time. It is a process that will not happen over night, but I can guarantee, that when you put in the time, work, and patience…you will see that plant begin to grow. One IMPORTANT takeaway is, <span class="underline">DO NOT</span> try to <span class="underline">SELL</span>. Find out your friends’ goals, their dreams, their vices, their strengths. You will want to help them by recommending, sharing YOUR personal fitness/life journey, by connecting and helping one person at a time (via private/personal messages). It’s all about building relationships and friendships. Developing trust and credibility with one person at a time is key!</td>

Realize “mass shout outs” like “buy from me,” “join me” are a turn off to most people, even if you have the best of intentions. Get interested in others and their needs and they will surely become interested in you!</td>
